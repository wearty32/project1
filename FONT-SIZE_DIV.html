<p class="par-1">(10*1.5=15) Let's move straight on to look at properties for<div class="b2" style="font-weight:bold">(10*1.5*2.5=37.5) styling fonts</div>.
 In this example we'll apply some different CSS properties to

<div class="b2">
<p class="par-2">Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
 may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat 
had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
 this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban

<p class="par-3"> This system works well, but traditionally web developers' font choices were limited. 
There are only a handful of fonts that you can guarantee to be available across all common systems 
— the so-called Web-safe fonts. You can use the font stack to specify preferable fonts,
 followed by web-safe alternatives, followed by the default system font, but this adds
 overhead in terms of testing to make sure that your designs look ok with each font, etc</p>
