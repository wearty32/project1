<p> what is font here  ? -- IS Times New Roman—Local file </p>
<p class="par-1">serif-font Let's move straight on to look at properties for styling fonts.
 In this example we'll apply some different CSS properties to 
the same HTML sample, which looks like this:</p>

<p class="par-2">sans-serif-font Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
 may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat 
had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
 this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban 
predator — Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare 
occasion such as this that he did.</p>

<p class="par-3">monospace-font This system works well, but traditionally web developers' font choices were limited. 
There are only a handful of fonts that you can guarantee to be available across all common systems 
— the so-called Web-safe fonts. You can use the font stack to specify preferable fonts,
 followed by web-safe alternatives, followed by the default system font, but this adds
 overhead in terms of testing to make sure that your designs look ok with each font, etc</p>
<p class="cursive">Cursive-Fonts that are intended to emulate handwriting, with flowing, connected strokes.</p4>
<p class=="fantasy"> Fantasy-Font that are intended to be decorative.</p>
