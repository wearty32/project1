<p> What involved TEXT in CSS </p>
<p class="font-style">As you'll have already experienced in your work with HTML and CSS, text inside 
an element is laid out inside the element's content box. It starts at the top left of the content area 
(or the top right, in the case of RTL language content), and flows towards the end of the line. 
Once it reaches the end, it goes down to the next line and continues, 
then the next line, <span class="text-layout">until all the content has been placed in the box.</span> 
Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, 
being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, 
and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached,
 or unless you force a line break manually using the <br> element. </p>
